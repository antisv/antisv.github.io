            I'm a math student at RWTH Aachen with a minor in computer science.  
            Besides my more formal academic pursuits, I am interested in psychology, especially psychometrics, economics, political philosophy, and literature.  
            I am usually open for work, internships, or projects, so feel free to contact me.
