    <section>
        <p>
            Set up and co-led a school parliament as part of a pilot project at select Bavarian high schools, read more about it <a href=https://www.martin-behaim-gymnasium.de/konstituierung-des-schulparlaments>here</a> and <a href=https://www.nn.de/region/handy-in-der-schule-behaim-gymnasium-in-nurnberg-diskutiert-1.13238097>here</a>.  
            I also initiated and led various other projects as Student Council President over two years, usually working with and managing a group of ~30 people.
